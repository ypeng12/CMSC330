# Discussion 9 - Friday, November 4<sup>th</sup>

## Coding Exercise
* To go from source code to a running program, there are 3 steps (at least for our purposes):
    * Tokenizing/Lexing (separating text into smaller tokens)
    * Parsing (generating something meaningful from the tokens - an AST)
    * Interpreting (evaluating the result of the AST) 

* Consider the following grammar:
    * S -> M + S | M
    * M -> N * M | N
    * N -> n | (S)
    * where n is any integer

* This grammar is right associative/recursive (Why did we provide a right associative grammar? What would you do if we didn't?).

* What is the relative precedence of the + and \* operators here? How is it determined? How can we use CFGs to enforce precedence?

### Lexer
* Open `lexer.skeleton.ml`.
* Answer key in `lexer.ml`
* Note the variant type `token` we have defined.
* Keep an index that keeps track of where we are in the string, and move forward as we keep tokenizing.
* In P4, you will have to worry about the order in which you have `if/else` ... `if/else` statements (certain regexs should be checked before others).
* It's probably also a good idea to just define all the regex's and store in variables at the top.

### Parser
* Open `parser.skeleton.ml`.
* Answer key in `parser.ml` (will be uploaded after discussion)
* Note the variant type `expr` that we have defined
* Note: Use `let rec ...` and to write mutually recursive functions.
* Note: `lookahead` just returns the head of the list.
* Note: `match` just "consumes" the head of the list (provided that the token and head of the list match).
* IMPORTANT: 
    * We're going to write a function named `parse_X` for each nonterminal `X` in our grammar.
    * Each of these functions will parse (consume) some tokens, and return (1) the unparsed tokens and (2) the AST which corresponds to the parsed tokens.
